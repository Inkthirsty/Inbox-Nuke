# Inbox Nuke
This tool was created for personal experimentation, to test how many messages can be sent to an inbox for emails you own. Do not use this on email addresses that do not belong to you. Any illegal or unethical use of this software is your responsibility. This project is intended for educational or experimental purposes only; misuse is strongly discouraged.
